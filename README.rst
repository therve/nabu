OpenStack event subscriber

A small service to push events generated by Ceilometer to Zaqar queues. It
provides a subscription API and a Ceilometer event dispatcher.

Usage
-----


Nabu provides a simple API to susbcribe to events. You can invoke it this way:

    curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $token" -H "Content-Type': application/json" -X POST -d '{"source": "compute", "target": "compute-events"}' http://$nabu_url/v1/subscription 

This will send all compute events to the given Zaqar queue. You can then use
the regular Zaqar API to list events there, or the WebSocket transport to get
notified immediately upon new events. See ``example.py`` for a completed
end-to-end example.
